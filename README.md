Track, count, and graph

Disappointed by BetterCounter's lack of support for negative and decimal numbers, I decided to make my own.

This project is in it's earliest stages of development, but it already has feature parody with BetterCounter, except with Double precision and the ability to delete ticks. it's not pretty, but an initial release build is coming soon.
